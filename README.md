# Sharity
Introducing Sharity, an innovative platform designed to tackle zero hunger by making it easier than ever to find and connect with resources in your community. Imagine a real-time map that not only shows where you can find food and essential supplies but also highlights local charities and organisations that are making a difference. Sharity allows you to see at a glance which areas are offering critical support, helping those in need to access what they require, exactly when they need it.

But Sharity doesn't stop there. It's also a powerful tool for volunteers and charitable organizations to connect. Charities can broadcast their mission, share urgent needs, and rally volunteers directly through the platform. This creates a dynamic community of support where people can come together, offer help, and make a tangible impact on the fight against hunger. With Sharity, we're transforming the way communities unite to ensure no one goes withoutâ€”because together, we can end hunger for good.
